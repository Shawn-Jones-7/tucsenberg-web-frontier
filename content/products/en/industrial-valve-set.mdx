## Product Overview

The IV-Series encompasses our complete range of industrial process valves, engineered to provide reliable flow control across diverse applications. From general service to severe duty, our valves meet the stringent requirements of modern process industries.

### Product Categories

#### Ball Valves

Full port and reduced port designs for on/off and throttling service.

| Type | Features | Applications |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Floating Ball | Cost-effective, tight shutoff | General service, HVAC |
| Trunnion Mounted | High pressure, low torque | Oil & gas, pipelines |
| V-Port | Precise flow control | Throttling applications |
| Three-Way | Diverting/mixing | Process changeover |

#### Gate Valves

Rising and non-rising stem designs for full-flow isolation.

- Solid wedge gate for general service
- Flexible wedge for thermal cycling
- Knife gate for slurries and solids

#### Globe Valves

Precision throttling and flow regulation.

- Standard pattern for general throttling
- Angle pattern for direction change
- Y-pattern for minimal pressure drop

#### Check Valves

Prevent backflow and protect equipment.

- Swing check for horizontal lines
- Lift check for vertical applications
- Dual plate (wafer) for space savings
- Silent check for water hammer prevention

### Material Selection Guide

| Service | Body | Trim | Seals |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Water/Steam | Carbon steel WCB | 13Cr | PTFE/Graphite |
| Chemical | SS316 (CF8M) | SS316 | PTFE |
| Oil & Gas | Carbon steel | Stellite | Graphite |
| Cryogenic | SS304 (CF8) | SS304 | RPTFE |
