## Introduction

Proper documentation is the backbone of international trade. Incomplete or incorrect documents can delay shipments, trigger customs holds, and result in financial penalties. This guide covers the essential documents you need for successful export transactions.

## Core Commercial Documents

### 1. Commercial Invoice

The commercial invoice is the primary document for customs valuation and serves as a record of the transaction.

**Required Information:**

- Seller name, address, contact details
- Buyer name, address, contact details
- Invoice number and date
- Detailed description of goods
- Quantity and unit of measure
- Unit price and total value
- Currency of transaction
- Incoterms and payment terms
- Country of origin
- Harmonized System (HS) codes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- ❌ Vague product descriptions
- ❌ Missing HS codes
- ❌ Inconsistent quantities across documents
- ❌ Incorrect Incoterms notation

### 2. Packing List

Details the contents and packaging of each shipment unit.

**Required Information:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Shipper/Consignee | Names and addresses |
| Package numbers | Sequential numbering |
| Contents per package | Item description and quantity |
| Net weight | Weight of goods only |
| Gross weight | Including packaging |
| Dimensions | L × W × H per package |
| Total packages | Complete count |

**Best Practice:** Create packing lists that match invoice line items exactly.

### 3. Bill of Lading (B/L)

The transport document serving as receipt, contract of carriage, and document of title.

**Types of B/L:**

| Type | Use Case | Title Transfer |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Original B/L | Traditional trade, L/C | Negotiable |
| Sea Waybill | Trusted partners | Non-negotiable |
| Telex Release | Quick release needed | Release at destination |
| Express B/L | Standard shipments | Non-negotiable |

**Critical Elements:**

- Shipper and consignee details
- Notify party information
- Port of loading and discharge
- Container/seal numbers
- Freight terms (prepaid/collect)
- Number of original B/Ls issued

> **Important:** For Letter of Credit transactions, B/L details must match L/C requirements exactly.

### 4. Air Waybill (AWB)

For air freight shipments, the AWB serves similar functions to the B/L.

**Key Differences from B/L:**

- Always non-negotiable
- Cannot serve as document of title
- Single original (carrier copy)
- Faster processing

## Certificates and Compliance Documents

### 5. Certificate of Origin (CO)

Declares the country where goods were manufactured or substantially transformed.

**Types:**

1. **Non-preferential CO**: General origin declaration
2. **Preferential CO**: Qualifies for reduced tariffs under trade agreements
3. **Form A**: For Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)

**Issuing Authorities:**

- Chamber of Commerce (most countries)

- Authorized export agencies

### 6. Inspection Certificates

Third-party verification of product quality, quantity, or specifications.

**Common Types:**

| Certificate | Purpose | Typical Issuer |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
